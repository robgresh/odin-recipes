    <p>This is the chicken recipe from MPM for snack city.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 lbs (2270 g) boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>2½ cups (250 g) corn chex ground</li>
        <li>½ cups (60 g) tapioca flour or cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tbsp (45 g) water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) oil spray</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your chicken breasts into chicken finger sized pieces. I shoot for between 1"-1.5" in diameter and 4-5" long. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prep your breading by placing the corn chex into a blender or food processor and blending into a flour. Lightly season the breading with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set up three bowls, one with the eggs and water beaten together, one with the cornstarch, and one with the breading. You can also use large ziplock bags for the breading steps if you wish.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken in cornstarch, then dunk in the egg wash, and then transfer to the corn chex and coat evenly. Shake off any excess and place on a sheet pan to prepare to be air fried.</li>
        <li>Keep one of your hands as the wet hand for the eggs and one as the dry hand for the breading, this will keep it from gunking up on your fingers.</li>
        <li>Once all of your chicken is breaded, preheat your air fryer to 400°F. Place the chicken in a single layer in the basket and spray lightly with oil. Cook for 7-8 minutes then flip and lightly spray the other side. Cook for an additional 5-6 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked pieces on a wire rack to cool and repeat this process until you have cooked all of the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
